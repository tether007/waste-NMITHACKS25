source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

#### 4. Set up PostgreSQL
- Install PostgreSQL if you haven't already
- Create a new database:
  ```bash
  createdb wasteworks
  ```
- Or use the included setup script:
  ```bash
  chmod +x setup_database.sh
  ./setup_database.sh
  ```

#### 5. Configure environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
```
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/wasteworks

# Flask Configuration
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret_key
FLASK_ENV=development
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=true

# Optional: AI API Keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

#### 6. Initialize the database
```bash
python recreate_db.py
```

#### 7. Run the application
```bash
python main.py
```
The application will be available at http://localhost:5000

### Using Docker (Alternative)

If you prefer using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t wasteworks .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env wasteworks
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

The application uses several related models:

- **User**: Authentication, profile, and gamification data
- **WasteItem**: Uploaded waste items with AI analysis results
- **DropLocation**: Recycling centers and drop-off points
- **WasteJourneyBlock**: Blockchain-like tracking for waste journey
- **Achievement**: Gamification achievements and badges
- **Reward**: Points and rewards for user actions
- **InfrastructureReport**: Citizen reports of damaged infrastructure

## üìä API Endpoints

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploy to Render.com

This application is configured for easy deployment on Render.com:

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account
2. Sign up for Render.com and connect your GitHub account
3. Create a new Web Service and select your repository
4. Use the following settings:
   - Environment: Python
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements-render.txt`
   - Start Command: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers=2 main:app`

5. Add the following environment variables:
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: Generate a secure random string
   - `FLASK_ENV`: production
   - `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`: true
   - `PYTHON_VERSION`: 3.11.8

6. Create a PostgreSQL database in Render:
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí New ‚Üí PostgreSQL
   - Link it to your web service (Render will automatically set the DATABASE_URL environment variable)

7. Deploy your application
   - The application will automatically set up the database schema during the first deployment
   - If needed, you can run database migrations through the Render shell

### Database Management

For database schema updates after deployment:

```bash
